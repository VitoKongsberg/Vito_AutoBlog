Introduction</h1><h2 id="1-1-Introduction"><a href="#1-1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1.1 Introduction"></a>1.1 Introduction</h2><p>Hello and welcome  to the course on design  failure mode and effects analysis.</p><p>I’ll be your <mark>instructor</mark> for the course.</p><p>I’m a mechanical design engineer by profession and i worked in automotive R&amp;D and product development for more than fives years.</p><p>And i have been part of projects from concept to production stage through my experience designing systems.</p><p>Our found DFMEA  is a <mark>critical</mark> tool in understanding  the system and designing effectively  <mark>taking into acccount</mark> the risk involved in designing mechanical systems.</p><p>So what will this be about ?</p><p>In this course will primarily learn about preparing to defend me from mechanical systems or products.</p><p>We will cover the concepts involved in the DFMEA like what is failure mode?</p><p>How do you define a failure mode?</p><p>What are the causes or mechanisms of failure?</p><p>What are the possible effects and what do we mean by severity, occurrence and detection in the context</p><p>of mechanical design?</p><p>Then we’ll have a look at what our boundary diagrams and parameter diagrams, which are very important</p><p>tools to understand the overall system before going into the actual Levemir.</p><p>Then we will go through a familiar walkthrough of an example and basically understand the overall step</p><p>by step process of preparing the FMU.</p><p>So the main deliverable and learning outcome of this course would be to develop a strong, basic understanding</p><p>of how to start preparing effectively and productivity from you.</p><p>So the basic underlying concepts will be made clear in this course, and we will understand a lot about</p><p>why we are doing it rather than only understanding of what we are doing.</p><p>So if you are a mechanical design engineer who is into designing systems and into product development,</p><p>then this course should be really useful to you in preparing you for creating effective me.</p><h2 id="1-2-Risk-associated-in-Mechanical-design-and-need-for-DFMEA"><a href="#1-2-Risk-associated-in-Mechanical-design-and-need-for-DFMEA" class="headerlink" title="1. 2 Risk associated in Mechanical design and need for DFMEA"></a>1. 2 Risk associated in Mechanical design and need for DFMEA</h2><p>Hello and welcome to the course before we go in depth into the deal for me.</p><p>First, let us understand why.</p><p>Why should we do a deal for me?</p><p>So whenever we are designing mechanical systems or products, there is always some risk involved.</p><p>There is a famous Murphy’s Law which states that anything that can go wrong will go wrong, which means</p><p>that if there is a possibility of a failure to occur, it will eventually occur, whether sooner or</p><p>later the same cases with mechanical systems.</p><p>So mechanical systems can and will fail.</p><p>And that is true for any system as well.</p><p>Whether they are designing a software, whether designing a building or a bridge or whether they are</p><p>designing even organization’s systems will fail.</p><p>And we have to design in such a way that we reduce the risk so that we need to account for the risk</p><p>and we need to calculate the risk that becomes a key activity when designing systems.</p><p>So risk mitigation and designing mechanical products to have the least number of failures is very important</p><p>for the business as well as the reputation of a manufacturer.</p><p>So let’s say you’re designing a mechanical system.</p><p>Let’s say you’re designing a device which has to hold some amount of load.</p><p>Now, if when it goes to the customer, when it goes to the user, it fails, that is going to damage</p><p>the reputation of the manufacturer.</p><p>And also, in worst cases, it is going to be a safety hazard.</p><p>Hence, it becomes very important to account for all possible ways in which that device will fail,</p><p>to make sure that we are testing it for all possible worst cases and designing for it.</p><p>So designing to avoid failure.</p><p>First time when we are designing complex systems can become very tricky, especially when dealing with</p><p>mechanical systems, because not all risk can be known in the design phase itself.</p><p>So when we are designing mechanical systems, which are highly complex, so let’s say designing a vehicle,</p><p>a car from scratch, so you can’t expect the car to be mature in its design for the first time, you</p><p>design and analyze it.</p><p>That has to be a lot of exhaustive testing which has to take place and that testing is done to find</p><p>out what are the possible failure modes and hence design for those failure modes.</p><p>And the design will mature.</p><p>So it is always tricky to design first time without any failure.</p><p>That is generally not the case in mechanical systems.</p><p>Mechanical systems require a good amount of testing, actually testing for the proven.</p><p>There is also one of the reason why a mechanical product development as a practice is generally considered</p><p>more difficult as compared to, let’s say, a software product development.</p><p>So when you are developing a software, when you’re coding, you can debug it easily, but you cannot</p><p>debug a mechanical system design that easily.</p><p>You need a good amount of testing.</p><p>And so it is very important that the mechanical products are physically tested in product development</p><p>office.</p><p>But even if they are tested, all possible ways in which the product will fail may not have been recorded</p><p>and hence designed for even in the product development phase.</p><p>So this possibility is always that we cannot say that 100 percent out of the product and all of the</p><p>failure modes, all of the possible failure modes are covered in the testing.</p><p>So that confidence level is generally not 100 percent.</p><p>It can be either 80 percent or maybe 90 percent, or it cannot be 100 percent, because there always</p><p>be new types of failure modes which may pop up, especially when we are dealing with complex systems.</p><p>And most importantly, if the failures happen in the hands of the customer, then it can be detrimental</p><p>to the success of the product, accounting for the risk and hence documenting it is very important for</p><p>designing mechanical systems.</p><p>So it has to be taken a lot of care when we are designing systems that we are accounting for the possible</p><p>risks involved when someone is using that mechanical system.</p><p>So if you are designing, let’s say, a system which is dealing with the safety of individuals, there</p><p>has to be utmost care in making sure all of the risks have been documented and have been accounted for</p><p>before releasing the design for production.</p><p>So here is a graph of risk with this product development stages, so the risk involved in design stage</p><p>is generally very low.</p><p>If you find any errors or issues in the design through simulation or analysis, it’s easy to change</p><p>the design with no major cost impact.</p><p>But as we advance in the product development stages, if the issues get highlighted at the production</p><p>stage, then it will be considered as high risk and it will incur heavy costs because we have to change</p><p>the assembly lines.</p><p>We have to change the assembly infrastructure, the production stages when the design has been frozen</p><p>and the design has been handed over from the engineering team to the production team.</p><p>So these issues, when they hide it from the production team, they generally incur heavy cost and lead</p><p>to a lot of changes.</p><p>Even worse than that would be issues which are highlighted when it’s in the field, when the product</p><p>is in the field, in the hands of the customer.</p><p>That is after sales.</p><p>So the risk is much higher because it is not only cost which is incurred, it is also a matter of reputation.</p><p>So then the question arises, how do we account for risk and documented?</p><p>So we can do that by understanding, analyzing and documenting the failure modes that causes and that</p><p>effects and devise testing procedures to capture them.</p><p>And finally, to design in such a way that we are avoiding their occurrences.</p><p>And the major tool for doing that is BFM.</p><p>You give me a sense of a design failure mode effect analysis.</p><p>So the DSM is a tool to evaluate and minimize the risk involved in mechanical design.</p><p>Actually, more than a tool to make can also be a framework for the design engineer to design systems.</p><p>So David Muir is covering all of the possible considerations when it comes to design.</p><p>It’s not only for its strength, it’s not only for various functional requirements, but the overall</p><p>performance of the product can be captured in the image.</p><p>And that is why it is such a versatile and very useful tool and framework for design engineers to design</p><p>products.</p><p>And also, it becomes a record and history of the product or the system or part being designed.</p><h2 id="1-3-What-DFMEA-accommplishes"><a href="#1-3-What-DFMEA-accommplishes" class="headerlink" title="1.3 What DFMEA accommplishes"></a>1.3 What DFMEA accommplishes</h2><p>So apart from accounting and recording the risk associated with the design, what does the FMJ design</p><p>engineers to do?</p><p>Firstly, it allows us to develop a deep understanding of the product and system and basically enhance</p><p>our knowledge about the product of the system being developed.</p><p>Because when you do the for me, you will very deliberately try to brainstorm on the ways in which the</p><p>product or the system can fail, and hence that will develop a very deep and very intricate understanding</p><p>of the system.</p><p>Apart from that, it creates a systematic way of dealing with issues, categorizing them and prioritizing</p><p>them.</p><p>So prioritization of issues is very important because, of course, time and resources are generally</p><p>limited in a product development project and the ones which are the most severe, the most severe failure</p><p>modes of first to and after that, the other ones are looked at.</p><p>On what basis is the product to be evaluated or validated to avoid these failure modes, so the department</p><p>gives us a guidance as to what has to be evaluated and what has to be validated in terms of the design.</p><p>And it becomes a reference document for the preparation of testing plans, which are called design verification</p><p>plans.</p><p>So this design modification plans, LADEE foundation of what is to be tested to how much and which factor</p><p>has to be analyzed when we are testing it.</p><p>So all of that comes from having a very good understanding of the product and the system through the DFMEA.</p><p>Apart from these days, FEMA also gives us the breakdown to the most critical components of an assembly with respect to various failure modes.</p><p>So let’s say you are having an assembly or system and it is having a certain failure mode.</p><p>And when you’re trying to find out what is the root cause, you are at a certain characteristic or a certain dimension of a part which is troublesome so that the information can be used to target these exact characteristics of various parts which are causing the trouble, and hence we can have control measures to control them in a better way in manufacturing.</p><p>So do you for me, is a very important tool, especially if you want to do a thoughtful and exhaustive design of a barter system.</p><p>And also it helps the A document which can be referred in future when we are designing similar products.</p><h1 id="2-Basics-of-DFMEA"><a href="#2-Basics-of-DFMEA" class="headerlink" title="2.

      <title>How To Read DC Motor &amp; Gear Motor Performance Curves</title>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Understanding-The-Basics"><a href="#Understanding-The-Basics" class="headerlink" title="Understanding The Basics"></a>Understanding The Basics</h2><p><font color="red"><strong>This article is excerpted from ISL and is only used for personal learning and testing hexo.</strong> </font ></p><p>A motor &#x2F; gear motor performance curve conveys five specific parameters; speed, torque, current draw, power and efficiency. The overall performance data will illustrate the optimal conditions the motor should operate at as well as its limitations. This information can be used to determine if the motor will be ideal for your application or device.</p><p><img src="https://islproducts.com/wp-content/uploads/dc-motor-performance-curve-basics.png" alt="dc motor performance curve basic"></p><h3 id="Speed-N"><a href="#Speed-N" class="headerlink" title="Speed (N)"></a>Speed (N)</h3><p>Measured in revolutions per minute (rpm), this straight, downward sloping line shows the relationship between torque and speed over the entire power-band (see blue line in example above). Since speed and torque are indirectly proportional to one another, this line will decrease linearly as torque increases up until the stall point, at which the speed will be 0 rpm.</p><p>Speed and torque have an inverse relationship. The speed is highest when the motor is producing the least torque, and when the torque is highest the motor is barely turning.</p><h3 id="Efficiency-η"><a href="#Efficiency-η" class="headerlink" title="Efficiency (η)"></a>Efficiency (η)</h3><p>Efficiency is a relationship between the input power and output power, given as a percentage (%). This line is more or less parabolic with the vertex more towards the lower torque values (see pink line in example above). It typically peaks early on in the torque range then slowly decreases as the motor gets closer to its stall torque.</p><p>Using the motor near it’s peak efficiency ensures optimal motor life and power consumption. It is best practice to use a motor at or near its peak efficiency. The further away a motor gets from max efficiency, its performance becomes less reliable.</p><h3 id="Torque-T"><a href="#Torque-T" class="headerlink" title="Torque (T)"></a>Torque (T)</h3><p>Whether measured in kg-cm, lb-in, or Nm, torque is the amount of load the motor or gear motor output shaft can overcome. On a dc motor &#x2F; gear motor performance curve, torque is usually represented by the X-axis.</p><p>The intersection of the speed line (<em>N</em>) and the X-axis is the stall torque (T) point. This is where the motor produces its maximum torque and can no longer rotate. Make sure that the force needed from the motor is much less than the overall torque capacity (stall torque), otherwise the motor will not work as intended and will have a high risk of being damaged.</p><h3 id="Current-I"><a href="#Current-I" class="headerlink" title="Current (I)"></a>Current (I)</h3><p>Represented by the straight ascending line (see teal line in example above), this reflects current draw from no load to stall conditions. This line shows the direct relationship between amperage and torque.</p><p>If your application is power conscious, it would be best practice to operate the motor at peak efficiency. This gets the most balanced performance out of the motor while demanding a reasonable amount of current. During motor performance evaluation, noting the current draw will allow you to more accurately understand the on-load conditions a motor sees within your application.</p><h3 id="Output-Power-P"><a href="#Output-Power-P" class="headerlink" title="Output Power (P)"></a>Output Power (P)</h3><p>Possibly the simplest number on the whole graph, Output Power shows how much power (in Watts) a motor can deliver (see green line in example above).</p><p>Power is a measurement of work over time and is usually illustrated by a standard parabolic shape. The motor’s power depends on both speed and torque, the power is low when speed is high and torque is very low.  The opposite situation is also true, when speed is low and torque is high the power will also be low. This means power usually peaks at the midpoint between the maximum speed and the stall point.</p><h2 id="Performance-Curve-Interpretation"><a href="#Performance-Curve-Interpretation" class="headerlink" title="Performance Curve Interpretation"></a>Performance Curve Interpretation</h2><p>Now that we have covered the basics, you can begin to understand what the lines and numbers represent. The performance curve below is a more detailed performance representation for a typical dc gear motor. We will use this curve as a frame of reference to help explain how to properly determine the overall performance aspects and other important factors like the rated performance.</p><p><img src="https://islproducts.com/wp-content/uploads/dc-gear-motor-performance-curve-example.png" alt="dc gear motor performance curve example"></p><p>Here are the specific specifications based on the gear motor performance curve above:</p><table><thead><tr><th><strong>Parameter</strong></th><th><strong>Value</strong></th><th><strong>Unit</strong></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>No-Load Speed</td><td>58</td><td>rpm</td></tr><tr><td>No-Load Current</td><td>0.5</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>Rated Speed</td><td>48</td><td>rpm</td></tr><tr><td>Rated Torque</td><td>2.5</td><td>Nm</td></tr><tr><td>Rated Current</td><td>2.5</td><td>A</td></tr><tr><td>Rated Power</td><td>12.8</td><td>W</td></tr><tr><td>Max. Efficiency</td><td>43</td><td>%</td></tr><tr><td>Max. Power</td><td>22.7</td><td>W</td></tr><tr><td>Stall Torque</td><td>15</td><td>Nm</td></tr><tr><td>Stall Current</td><td>12</td><td>A</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Gear Motor performance curves give you an opportunity to evaluate a motor on paper to see if it’s the most optimal choice for your application. By comparing your applications desired performance to the graph you can theoretically test the motor before samples are made. As with any other electromechanical component, you want it to operate as efficiently as possible. You can use the performance curve to easily determine the motor or gear motors maximum efficiency point or rated performance.</p><h3 id="Rated-Performance"><a href="#Rated-Performance" class="headerlink" title="Rated Performance"></a>Rated Performance</h3><p>To find the rated or nominal operating performance of a motor &#x2F; gear motor, the first step is to locate the peak efficiency point (pink line). In the graph above, the peak efficiency is at 43%. Once you locate the maximum efficiency point, draw a vertical line through that point (see black dotted line), from the top of the graph to the bottom to determine all other rated performance parameters. Each time your vertical line intersects with another line within the graph, it indicates each of the rated performance values.</p><p>Using the graph above, the rated performance of this gear motor would be: 2.5Nm &#x2F; 48 rpm&#x2F; 43% &#x2F; 2.5A &#x2F; 12.8W.</p><p>** Please note that there are usually multiple parameter scales on Y-Axes.*  </p><p><a href="https://islproducts.com/contact/">Discuss with an Engineer</a></p><h2 id="Continuous-and-Intermittent-Usage"><a href="#Continuous-and-Intermittent-Usage" class="headerlink" title="Continuous and Intermittent Usage"></a><strong>Continuous and Intermittent Usage</strong></h2><p><a href="https://islproducts.com/dc-motors-and-dc-gear-motors/">Electric motors</a> have two types of usage which are defined by torque capacity in which they are operating at. These ranges are meant to depict the overall safe operating limits of the motor or gear motor. Defining your overall duty cycle is a key factor when determining the type of usage range a motor or gear motor will be operating within.</p><p><img src="https://islproducts.com/wp-content/uploads/dc-motor-usage-range.png" alt="dc motor usage ranges"></p><h3 id="Continuous-Usage-Range"><a href="#Continuous-Usage-Range" class="headerlink" title="Continuous Usage Range"></a>Continuous Usage Range</h3><p>This occurs between 0% and 30% of the overall torque capacity (stall torque). This range encompass the motors max efficiency point and can operate consistently without risking premature failure. Within this range thermals are not an issue, as long as the ambient temperature is not excessively high. This is the safest range to operate the motor.</p><h3 id="Intermittent-Usage-Range"><a href="#Intermittent-Usage-Range" class="headerlink" title="Intermittent Usage Range"></a>Intermittent Usage Range</h3><p>This range falls between 30% and 60% of the overall torque capacity. This is where the motor can perform sporadic tasks, but should not run consistently in order to sustain general motor health. Implementing active cooling can allow motors to operate here for longer periods of time and have less frequent dwell times. Keep in mind, the further you move away from the max efficiency point, the higher the current draw will be and also the chances of premature failure increase.</p><h3 id="Danger-Zone"><a href="#Danger-Zone" class="headerlink" title="Danger Zone"></a>Danger Zone</h3><p>We will refer to this area above 60% of the torque capacity. It is highly advised that you do not operate a motor in this area! At these loads the motor will overheat quickly, increasing the chance of the motor winding burning out and&#x2F;or gearbox failure, if equipped.</p><p>While these are useful approximations when selecting a motor or gear motor, they are not concrete rules. Please use this information as a frame of reference to help aid in your motor selection.  It’s always best to check with your motor vendor or supplier to make sure the motor you are picking is the optimal selection for your application and duty cycle.
